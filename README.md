# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Segmentation** using demographic and customer data to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing and business strategies. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, and interpretation of results.

## Objectives

- Analyze demographic data to clean and preprocess datasets.
- Perform feature selection and engineering to prepare data for clustering.
- Use unsupervised learning techniques (e.g., k-means clustering) to segment customers.
- Interpret and visualize results to derive actionable business insights.

## Project Structure

- **`Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering, and visualizations.
- **`Identify_Customer_Segments.html`**: HTML report summarizing the notebook's findings and key results.
- **Datasets**:
  - **`Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`**: A dataset containing demographic data for clustering.
  - **`Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`**: A dataset with customer information to analyze.
  - **`AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`**: A CSV file summarizing the demographic dataset's features.
- **Supporting Files**:
  - **`Temp.ipynb`**: A temporary notebook for testing or auxiliary analysis.
  - **`.Rhistory`**: A history file from an R session (optional, may not be used in this project).

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and more.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and code execution.
- **HTML Reporting**: Summarizes the analysis results for easy sharing.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and inconsistent data.
   - Map categorical features to numerical values.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Normalize and scale data for clustering.
   - Reduce dimensionality where necessary.
3. **Clustering**:
   - Apply k-means or other clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer groups.
   - Optimize cluster numbers using techniques like the elbow method.
4. **Results Interpretation**:
   - Visualize clusters and analyze group characteristics.
   - Relate findings to business objectives.

## Results

The project identifies key customer segments, providing insights into customer behavior and demographic profiles. These insights can help businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Customer-Segmentation.git
   cd Customer-Segmentation
   ```
2. Open the main notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
